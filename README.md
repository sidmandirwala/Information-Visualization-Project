# NYC Crime Patterns: A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Public Safety
---
A comprehensive, interactive data visualization project analyzing crime trends in New York City over the last decade. This application transforms complex NYPD complaint data into an engaging narrative, exploring how crime has evolved through pre-pandemic stability, the COVID-19 shock, and the post-pandemic "new normal."

2.  **Hotspots**: Where are crime hotspots located across the five boroughs? (Bar Chart)
3.  **Crime Types**: What types of crimes are most prevalent by location? (Grouped Bar Chart)
4.  **Temporal Patterns**: How do different crimes exhibit distinct daily rhythms? (Area Chart)
5.  **Spatiotemporal Evolution**: How do crime patterns evolve across both space and time? (Multi-line Chart)
6.  **Crime Locations**: Where do different types of crimes typically occur? (Sankey Diagram)
7.  **Precinct Analysis**: How do crime rates vary across police precincts? (Choropleth Map)
8.  **Multi-Dimensional Insights**: What insights emerge when filtering by multiple dimensions? (Interactive Dashboard)


This project is a fully collaborative effort between **Siddh Mandirwala (sm12505)** and **Krish Murjani (km6520)**.
